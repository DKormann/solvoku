# solvoku

python sudoku solver

In this project I tried out a data oriented approach to solving sudokus in python.

I challenged myself to find a performant solution in less than 100 lines of code and without using classes.

The solution uses depth-first tree search and relies heavily on numpy arrays to store the progress and for fast data manipulation.
